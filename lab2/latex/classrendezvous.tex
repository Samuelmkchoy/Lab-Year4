The task function executed by each thread.  




\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
The task function executed by each thread. 

This function demonstrates a simple barrier synchronization using Semaphores. Each thread prints "{}first"{}, increments a shared counter, waits for all threads to arrive at the barrier, prints "{}second"{}, and repeats the process.


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em number\+Arrived} & A shared pointer to a counter tracking the number of threads that arrived. \\
\hline
{\em mutex\+Sem} & A shared pointer to a \doxylink{class_semaphore}{Semaphore} for mutual exclusion. \\
\hline
{\em barrier\+Sem} & A shared pointer to a \doxylink{class_semaphore}{Semaphore} for barrier synchronization. \\
\hline
{\em thread\+Count} & The total number of threads participating in the barrier. \\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
